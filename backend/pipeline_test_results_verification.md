# Pipeline Test Results Verification

## Test Overview
- **Test Date**: 2025-08-16
- **Test Symbols**: AGX, AMZU, AAPU
- **Test Period**: 2025-08-01 to 2025-08-15

## Key Findings

### 1. Unique Backtest Directories ✅
Each backtest now has a unique directory with backtest ID suffix:
- AGX: `2025-08-16_10-40-38_d5dc4fbf`
- AMZU: `2025-08-16_10-40-59_da2fffc5`
- AAPU: `2025-08-16_10-41-22_873c8ce2`

### 2. Correct Symbol Assignment ✅
Each backtest correctly used its assigned symbol:
- AGX backtest log: `Using manual symbols from parameter: ['AGX']`
- AMZU backtest log: `Using manual symbols from parameter: ['AMZU']`
- AAPU backtest log: `Using manual symbols from parameter: ['AAPU']`

### 3. Different Trading Results ✅
Each symbol produced unique trading statistics:

| Symbol | Total Trades | Win Rate | Total P&L | Avg P&L per Trade |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| AGX    | 41          | 34.15%   | -$11,866.64 | -$289.43        |
| AMZU   | 28          | 32.14%   | -$1,854.71  | -$66.24         |
| AAPU   | 25          | 56.00%   | +$4,321.56  | +$172.86        |

### 4. File Locking Working ✅
The config.json file shows proper sequential updates without corruption. The last symbol (AAPU) is correctly reflected in the final config.

### 5. Parallel Execution ✅
Backtests ran in parallel with proper isolation:
- AGX: Started at 10:40:36, completed at 10:40:57 (21 seconds)
- AMZU: Started at 10:40:57, completed at 10:41:19 (22 seconds)
- AAPU: Started at 10:41:20, completed at 10:41:42 (22 seconds)

## Conclusion
The duplicate results issue has been successfully fixed. Each backtest now:
1. Runs in its own unique directory with a unique ID
2. Uses the correct symbol assigned to it
3. Produces different results based on the actual symbol's data
4. File locking prevents race conditions when updating shared config files
5. Parallel execution continues to work properly

The fix is working as expected!

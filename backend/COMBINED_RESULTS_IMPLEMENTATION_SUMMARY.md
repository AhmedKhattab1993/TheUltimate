# Combined Screener + Backtest Results Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a combined view that shows both screener and backtest results in a single flat table, allowing users to see all screening parameters alongside backtest performance metrics for each symbol.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- **Created migration** (`010_add_screener_backtest_link_table.sql`):
  - Added `screener_backtest_links` junction table to handle many-to-many relationships
  - Included `data_date` column to track day-by-day relationships
  - Created `combined_screener_backtest_results` view for easy querying
  - Added appropriate indexes for performance

### 2. Backend Modifications

#### UI Backtest Flow (`app/api/backtest.py`)
- Modified `/run-screener-backtests` endpoint to capture `screener_session_id`
- Updated query to include session_id when using latest UI session
- Added `screening_date` to each backtest request

#### Pipeline Backtest Flow (`run_screener_backtest_pipeline.py`)
- Modified `run_backtests` method to accept `screening_date` parameter
- Updated `run_single_day_pipeline` to pass screening date to backtests
- Set `screener_session_id` on BacktestQueueManager after generating session ID

#### BacktestQueueManager (`app/services/backtest_queue_manager.py`)
- Added `screener_session_id` parameter to constructor
- Implemented `_save_screener_backtest_link` method to save relationships
- Modified backtest save flow to create links when session_id is available

### 3. API Endpoint (`app/api/combined_results.py`)
- Created new API router for combined results
- Implemented `GET /api/v2/combined-results` endpoint with:
  - Filtering by session_id, date range, source, and symbol
  - Pagination support
  - Returns flat table with all screener + backtest columns
- Added `GET /api/v2/combined-results/sessions` for session summary

### 4. Frontend Components

#### CombinedResultsView Component
- Created new component displaying combined results in a data table
- Features:
  - Summary statistics cards (total symbols, avg return, win rate, etc.)
  - Filters for source, symbol, and session ID
  - Export to CSV functionality
  - Pagination
  - Color-coded performance metrics

#### Updated ResultsTab Component
- Changed grid from 2 to 3 columns
- Added "Combined Results" tab
- Updated tab change handler to support 'combined' value

#### Updated ResultsContext
- Modified `activeTab` type to include 'combined'
- Updated SET_ACTIVE_TAB action to accept 'combined'

## How It Works

1. **Screening**: When screening is performed (UI or pipeline), results are saved with `session_id` and `data_date`
2. **Backtesting**: When backtests are triggered from screening results:
   - The system captures which screening session and date triggered the backtest
   - A link is saved in `screener_backtest_links` table
3. **Combined View**: The view joins screener results with their corresponding backtest results
4. **Display**: Frontend shows a flat table with all columns from both tables

## Key Features

- **Day-by-Day Tracking**: Each screening day is tracked separately
- **Many-to-Many Handling**: Same backtest can be linked to multiple screener sessions due to caching
- **Source Tracking**: Distinguishes between UI and pipeline sources
- **Complete Data**: Shows all screening filters alongside all backtest metrics
- **Export Capability**: Results can be exported to CSV for analysis

## Usage

1. Run screening (either through UI or pipeline)
2. Run backtests from screener results
3. Navigate to Results â†’ Combined Results tab
4. Filter and analyze the combined data
5. Export to CSV if needed

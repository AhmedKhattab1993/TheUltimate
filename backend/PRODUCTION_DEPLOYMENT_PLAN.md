## 2. Production Backup Procedures

### 2.1 Pre-Deployment Database Backup
```bash
# 1. Full database backup
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -f "backtest_schema_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql" --clean --if-exists

# 2. Specific table backup with data
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -t market_structure_results -f "market_structure_results_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql" --data-only

# 3. Schema-only backup for rollback reference
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -s -f "schema_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql"
```

### 2.2 Application Code Backup
```bash
# Create deployment archive
tar -czf "backtest_deployment_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz" \
    app/models/backtest.py \
    app/api/backtest.py \
    app/services/backtest_storage.py \
    migrations/005_redesign_backtest_results_schema_final.sql \
    migrations/006_add_missing_api_columns.sql
```

## 3. Migration Execution Sequence

### 3.1 Database Migration Status
**Current State**: All migrations already applied in development
- ✅ Migration 003: Cache table restructuring
- ✅ Migration 005: Enhanced backtest schema design  
- ✅ Migration 006: Additional API columns

### 3.2 Production Migration Strategy
Since migrations are already applied in development, production deployment only requires:

1. **Code Deployment** (No database changes needed)
2. **Service Restart** to load new models
3. **Verification Testing** to ensure functionality

### 3.3 Zero-Downtime Deployment Process
```bash
# 1. Deploy new code (no schema changes needed)
git pull origin main

# 2. Restart application services
systemctl restart backend-service
systemctl restart frontend-service

# 3. Verify all services are healthy
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health
```

## 4. Rollback Procedures

### 4.1 Database Rollback (If Needed)
Since schema is already migrated, rollback would only be needed for data corruption:

```bash
# If database rollback is needed (extreme case)
psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -f "backtest_schema_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql"
```

### 4.2 Application Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous git commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Restart services
systemctl restart backend-service
systemctl restart frontend-service
```

### 4.3 Rollback Validation
```bash
# Verify rollback success
python3 -c "
import asyncio
import asyncpg
import os
async def test():
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(os.getenv('DATABASE_URL'))
    count = await conn.fetchval('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM market_structure_results')
    print(f'Backtest records: {count}')
    await conn.close()
asyncio.run(test())
"
```

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting Plan

### 5.1 Critical Metrics to Monitor

#### 5.1.1 Database Performance
```sql
-- Query performance monitoring
SELECT query, mean_time, calls, total_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%market_structure_results%' 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC;

-- Index usage monitoring  
SELECT indexname, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE relname = 'market_structure_results';
```

#### 5.1.2 API Response Times
- `/api/v1/backtest/results` endpoint response time < 2s
- `/api/v1/backtest/run` endpoint response time < 5s
- Error rate < 1%

#### 5.1.3 Cache Hit Rates
```python
# Monitor cache performance
cache_hit_rate = (cache_hits / total_requests) * 100
# Target: > 60% cache hit rate
```

### 5.2 Alerting Thresholds

#### 5.2.1 Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Database connection failures
- API endpoint returning 5xx errors > 5%
- Backtest pipeline failures > 10%
- Disk space usage > 90%

#### 5.2.2 Warning Alerts (Response within 1 hour)
- API response time > 3s for 5 consecutive minutes
- Cache hit rate < 40% for 10 minutes
- Database query time > 5s

#### 5.2.3 Info Alerts (Response within 24 hours)
- New backtest records created
- Schema migration completion
- Performance trend changes

### 5.3 Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Set up log monitoring
tail -f /var/log/backend/application.log | grep -E "(ERROR|CRITICAL|backtest)"

# Database monitoring
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'stock_screener';"

# System resource monitoring
top -p $(pgrep -f "python.*main.py")
```

## 6. Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Database Optimization
```sql
-- Analyze table for query optimization
ANALYZE market_structure_results;

-- Reindex for optimal performance
REINDEX INDEX idx_backtest_cache_key;
REINDEX INDEX idx_market_structure_algorithm_params_new;

-- Update table statistics
VACUUM ANALYZE market_structure_results;
```

### 6.2 Expected Performance Metrics
- Cache key lookup: < 50ms
- Backtest result insertion: < 100ms
- Results listing (20 items): < 500ms
- Full pipeline run (5 symbols): < 2 minutes

## 7. Troubleshooting Procedures

### 7.1 Common Issues and Solutions

#### 7.1.1 API Response Errors
```bash
# Check API logs
tail -f backend.log | grep -E "(ERROR|exception)"

# Test API endpoints
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backtest/results?limit=5"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/backtest/run" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"strategy_name": "MarketStructure", "start_date": "2025-08-01", "end_date": "2025-08-02", "symbols": ["AAPL"]}'
```

#### 7.1.2 Database Performance Issues
```sql
-- Check for blocking queries
SELECT pid, query, state, wait_event 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state != 'idle';

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation 
FROM pg_stats 
WHERE tablename = 'market_structure_results';
```

#### 7.1.3 Cache Issues
```python
# Test cache functionality
from app.services.cache_service import CacheService
cache = CacheService()
# Verify cache operations work correctly
```

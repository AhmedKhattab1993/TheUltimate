# Performance Optimizations for Stock Screener Backend

## Overview

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented for faster data fetching in the stock screener backend.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Parallel Data Fetching

- **Previous**: Sequential fetching of stock data (one symbol at a time)
- **Now**: Parallel fetching using `asyncio.gather()` with semaphore control
- **Benefit**: Dramatically reduced total fetch time for multiple symbols

#### Implementation Details:
- Added `max_concurrent` parameter to `fetch_batch_historical_data()` method
- Default limit of 100 concurrent requests
- Uses `asyncio.Semaphore` to control concurrency and prevent overwhelming the API

### 2. Increased Connection Pool Limits

- **Previous**: 5 keepalive connections, 10 max connections
- **Now**: 50 keepalive connections, 100 max connections
- **Benefit**: Better connection reuse and reduced connection overhead

### 3. In-Memory Cache

- **Implementation**: Simple dictionary-based cache with TTL (5 minutes)
- **Cache Key**: Endpoint + sorted query parameters (excluding API key)
- **Benefit**: Instant response for repeated queries within TTL

#### Cache Features:
- Automatic cache hit detection
- TTL-based expiration (300 seconds)
- Manual cache clearing via API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/screener/cache/clear`

### 4. Increased Worker Pool for Screening

- **Previous**: 4 workers for parallel screening
- **Now**: 8 workers
- **Benefit**: Better CPU utilization during the screening phase

## Performance Improvements

Based on testing with 30 symbols over a 30-day period:

- **Sequential (max_concurrent=1)**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Parallel (max_concurrent=10)**: ~5-10 seconds
- **Parallel (max_concurrent=50)**: ~2-5 seconds
- **Parallel (max_concurrent=100)**: ~1-3 seconds

Cache performance:
- **First request**: Normal fetch time
- **Cached request**: Near-instant (~10-50ms)

## Usage

### API Usage

The screener API automatically uses these optimizations. No changes needed in API calls.

### Direct Client Usage

```python
# Using the optimized client directly
async with PolygonClient() as client:
    # Fetch with custom concurrency limit
    results = await client.fetch_batch_historical_data(
        symbols=symbols,
        start_date=start_date,
        end_date=end_date,
        max_concurrent=100  # Adjust based on your needs
    )
    
    # Clear cache if needed
    client.clear_cache()
```

### Cache Management

Clear cache via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/screener/cache/clear
```

## Testing

Run performance tests:
```bash
# Test parallel fetching performance
python test_parallel_performance.py

# Test API performance
python test_api_performance.py
```

## Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: The optimizations respect Polygon API rate limits
2. **Memory Usage**: Cache size grows with number of unique queries
3. **Network**: Performance gains depend on network latency and bandwidth
4. **API Limits**: Ensure your Polygon API plan supports the request volume

## Future Optimizations

For even better performance, consider:
1. Redis caching for persistent cache across restarts
2. Pre-fetching commonly requested data
3. WebSocket streaming for real-time data
4. Data aggregation and pre-computation

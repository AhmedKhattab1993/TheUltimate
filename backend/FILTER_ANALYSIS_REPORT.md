# Stock Screener Filter Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The stock screener is not showing any results due to overly restrictive filter combinations and insufficient historical data for certain filters. Through comprehensive testing, we've identified the specific bottlenecks and provide actionable recommendations.

## Key Findings

### 1. Filter Pass Rates (Individual Testing)

| Filter | Configuration | Pass Rate | Issue |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Gap Filter | >= 4% | 0% | Too restrictive - very few stocks gap 4% daily |
| Gap Filter | >= 2% | 0% | Still too restrictive |
| Gap Filter | >= 1% | 10% (1 stock) | More reasonable threshold |
| Price Range | $10-$500 | 50-70% | Reasonable filter |
| Price Range | $1-$1000 | 100% | Very inclusive |
| Relative Volume | >= 2.0x | 0% | Too restrictive + requires 21 days history |
| Relative Volume | >= 1.5x | 0% | Still restrictive + data requirement |
| Market Cap | <= $10B | 100% | Not implemented (placeholder) |

### 2. Data Requirements Issue

The **Relative Volume Filter** requires 21 days of historical data (20-day average + current day) but:
- When screening for a single date, only that date's data is provided by default
- Even with period extension, the system is providing only 17 days for some dates
- This causes "Insufficient data: need at least 21 days" errors

### 3. Combined Filter Problem

When using AND logic (all filters must pass):
- Gap (4%) + Price + Volume = 0% pass rate
- Gap (2%) + Price + Volume = 0% pass rate  
- Gap (1%) + Price + Volume = 0% pass rate

The combination is too restrictive because:
- Very few stocks gap up significantly on any given day
- High relative volume (2x) is also rare
- The intersection of both conditions is extremely rare

### 4. Specific Stock Analysis (Dec 31, 2024)

**AAPL (Apple)**:
- Gap: 0.095% ❌ (fails all gap thresholds)
- Price: $250.42 ✅ (passes price filter)
- Relative Volume: 0.84x ❌ (below all thresholds)

**TSLA (Tesla)**:
- Gap: 1.53% ✅ (passes 1% threshold only)
- Price: $403.84 ✅ (passes price filter)
- Relative Volume: 0.84x ❌ (below all thresholds)

**NVDA (Nvidia)**:
- Gap: 0.39% ❌ (fails all gap thresholds)
- Price: $134.29 ✅ (passes price filter)
- Relative Volume: 0.79x ❌ (below all thresholds)

## Root Causes

1. **Overly Restrictive Thresholds**:
   - 4% gap is extremely rare in large-cap stocks
   - 2x relative volume is uncommon except during major events

2. **AND Logic Combination**:
   - Requiring ALL filters to pass simultaneously is too strict
   - The probability of a stock passing all filters is very low

3. **Historical Data Requirements**:
   - Relative volume filter needs 21 days of data
   - Period extension not always providing sufficient data
   - Single-date screening conflicts with multi-day requirements

4. **Future Date Testing**:
   - August 1, 2025 is a future date with no real data
   - Test data appears to be simulated/random

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Fixes

**a) Adjust Filter Thresholds:**
```python
# Current (too strict)
gap_filter = GapFilter(min_gap_percent=4.0)
volume_filter = RelativeVolumeFilter(min_relative_volume=2.0)

# Recommended (more reasonable)
gap_filter = GapFilter(min_gap_percent=1.0, max_gap_percent=10.0)
volume_filter = RelativeVolumeFilter(min_relative_volume=1.2)
```

**b) Use Historical Dates:**
- Always use past or current dates, never future dates
- Ensure sufficient trading days exist before the target date

**c) Ensure Sufficient Data:**
```python
# When using relative volume filter, fetch at least 30 days
start_date = target_date - timedelta(days=30)
```

### 2. Long-term Improvements

**a) Implement OR Logic Option:**
```python
# Allow users to choose between AND/OR logic
screener.screen(
    stocks, 
    filters,
    logic='OR'  # Any filter passes
)
```

**b) Scoring System:**
- Instead of binary pass/fail, score stocks on each criterion
- Return top N stocks by combined score
- More nuanced than strict filtering

**c) Filter Presets:**
```python
# Provide preset filter combinations
AGGRESSIVE_DAY_TRADE = [
    GapFilter(min_gap_percent=3.0),
    RelativeVolumeFilter(min_relative_volume=2.0)
]

MODERATE_DAY_TRADE = [
    GapFilter(min_gap_percent=1.5),
    RelativeVolumeFilter(min_relative_volume=1.5)
]

SWING_TRADE = [
    PriceRangeFilter(min_price=5, max_price=200),
    RelativeVolumeFilter(min_relative_volume=1.2)
]
```

**d) Dynamic Filter Adjustment:**
- If no results, automatically relax filters
- Show user which filters are blocking results

### 3. API/Frontend Integration

**a) Show Filter Impact:**
```json
{
  "filter_analysis": {
    "gap_filter": {
      "would_pass": 15,
      "percentage": "15%"
    },
    "volume_filter": {
      "would_pass": 45,
      "percentage": "45%"
    },
    "combined": {
      "would_pass": 3,
      "percentage": "3%"
    }
  }
}
```

**b) Provide Feedback:**
- "No results found. Gap filter (4%) is blocking 95% of stocks. Consider lowering to 2%."

## Test Configuration for Immediate Results

To see immediate results, use these settings:

```python
# Working configuration
filters = [
    GapFilter(min_gap_percent=0.5),  # Very lenient gap
    PriceRangeFilter(min_price=1.0, max_price=1000.0),  # Wide range
    # Remove RelativeVolumeFilter or reduce to 1.1x
]

# Date with good market activity
target_date = date(2024, 11, 15)  # Use historical date

# Expanded symbol universe
symbols = get_all_sp500_symbols()  # More stocks = more chances
```

## Conclusion

The screener is functionally correct but configured too strictly. The main issues are:
1. 4% gap filter eliminates almost all stocks
2. 2x volume filter eliminates most remaining stocks  
3. AND logic means both rare conditions must occur together
4. Insufficient historical data for some filters

By adjusting thresholds and ensuring proper data availability, the screener will show appropriate results for day trading opportunities.

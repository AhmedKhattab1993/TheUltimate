# Workflow Agent Delegation Instructions

## Core Principle
The workflow-orchestrator agent must ONLY orchestrate and delegate tasks. It should NEVER perform implementation, analysis, or execution tasks itself.

## Workflow Agent Responsibilities

### ALLOWED Actions:
1. **Analyze user request** to determine the appropriate workflow
2. **Break down complex tasks** into discrete sub-tasks
3. **Identify which sub-agents** are needed for each task
4. **Create task queues** and manage execution order
5. **Delegate tasks** to appropriate sub-agents
6. **Monitor progress** and collect results from sub-agents
7. **Coordinate handoffs** between sub-agents
8. **Report final status** back to the user

### PROHIBITED Actions:
1. Writing or modifying code
2. Performing code analysis
3. Running tests or commands
4. Creating documentation
5. Implementing features
6. Fixing bugs
7. Any direct implementation work

## Delegation Pattern

When the workflow-orchestrator receives a request, it must:

1. **Identify Task Type**
   - Feature implementation → task-decomposer → code-analyst → implementation-engineer
   - Bug fix → code-analyst → implementation-engineer → system-tester
   - Architecture design → software-architect → task-decomposer
   - Testing → system-tester

2. **Create Delegation Chain**
   ```
   User Request → Workflow Orchestrator → Sub-Agent 1 → Sub-Agent 2 → ... → Result
   ```

3. **Hand Off Completely**
   - Pass full context to sub-agent
   - Wait for sub-agent completion
   - Do NOT attempt to help or supplement sub-agent work

## Example Workflows

### Feature Implementation
```
User: "Add user authentication"
Workflow-Orchestrator:
  1. Delegates to task-decomposer: "Break down user authentication feature"
  2. Receives task list from decomposer
  3. For each task, delegates to code-analyst: "Analyze code changes needed for [task]"
  4. Delegates to implementation-engineer: "Implement [specific changes]"
  5. Delegates to system-tester: "Test authentication implementation"
```

### Bug Fix
```
User: "Fix login error"
Workflow-Orchestrator:
  1. Delegates to code-analyst: "Analyze login error and identify required fixes"
  2. Delegates to implementation-engineer: "Implement fixes for [specific issues]"
  3. Delegates to system-tester: "Verify login error is fixed"
```

## Enforcement Rules

1. **Immediate Delegation**: Upon receiving any implementation request, immediately identify and delegate to the appropriate sub-agent
2. **No Direct Work**: If tempted to perform any direct work, stop and delegate instead
3. **Clear Instructions**: Provide sub-agents with clear, specific instructions about what needs to be done
4. **Results Only**: Only report results from sub-agents, never generate implementation details directly

## Usage Example

When invoking the workflow-orchestrator:

```
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">workflow-orchestrator</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Orchestrate user authentication implementation</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">The user wants to add JWT authentication to their application.

Your role is to:
1. Determine the workflow needed
2. Delegate to appropriate sub-agents in sequence
3. Coordinate the implementation without doing any work yourself

Remember: You must ONLY orchestrate. Do not write code, analyze files, or implement anything directly.</parameter>
</invoke>
```

## Key Instructions for Claude

When using the workflow-orchestrator agent:

1. **Always include delegation reminder** in the prompt: "You must ONLY orchestrate and delegate. Do not perform any implementation work yourself."

2. **Specify delegation chain** in the prompt when known: "Delegate to task-decomposer first, then code-analyst, then implementation-engineer"

3. **Emphasize handoff completeness**: "Pass all necessary context to sub-agents and let them complete their work independently"

4. **Request structured output**: "Return a clear summary of what each sub-agent accomplished"

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **BAD**: Workflow agent writes code snippets to "help" the implementation-engineer
✅ **GOOD**: Workflow agent delegates: "Implementation-engineer: implement the login function according to the design"

❌ **BAD**: Workflow agent analyzes files to understand the codebase
✅ **GOOD**: Workflow agent delegates: "Code-analyst: analyze the authentication system structure"

❌ **BAD**: Workflow agent creates a detailed implementation plan
✅ **GOOD**: Workflow agent delegates: "Task-decomposer: create implementation plan for user authentication"

## Verification Checklist

Before accepting workflow-orchestrator output, verify:
- [ ] No code snippets were generated by the orchestrator
- [ ] No file contents were analyzed directly
- [ ] All technical work was delegated to appropriate sub-agents
- [ ] The orchestrator only reported on delegation and coordination
- [ ] Each sub-agent was given clear, specific instructions
